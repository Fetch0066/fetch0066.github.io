                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Argentina is the second largest country in South America with a population of 44 million. As per other
                    Latin American nations, Argentina was initially under the Spanish Crown, with political leadership
                    being centered in Buenos Aires. In 1816, under the influence of José de San Martín, declared
                    independence,
                    with the city being made the nation’s capital in 1862. Throughout history, many Argentinians have
                    immigrated to America with reasons that mainly stem from instability back at home and a desire for
                    better opportunities.</p>
                <p>The content of this presentation, unless specified, was mainly crafted from combining and corroborating
                    information from Julio Rodriguez’s article “<i>Argentinian Americans</i>” and Andres J. Consoli, as well as
                    other Argentine immigrant’s article/chapter titled, “<i>Argentines in the United States: Migration and
                    Continuity</i>”, published in the book, “<i>Latinx Immigrants</i>”, from 2018.</p>

                <h2>Who Immigrated?</h2>
                <p>The authors of the Argentines in the United States offered their own personal accounts of immigration
                    (shown later in the presentation). This includes Andres and Eduardo, both of whom are psychologists,
                    Mercedes, a social worker, and Agustina, another psychologist. Many Argentinians who migrated to America
                    were considered intellectuals and/or refugees from a tumultuous country.</p>
                <p>An article by Mohamad Moslimani and other researchers from the Pew Research Center found that around
                    290,000 Hispanics of Argentine origin lived in the US in 2021. 160,000 of Argentine Americans were
                    foreign born, originally birthed outside of the US (likely Argentina), while the other 90,000 were born
                    within America.</p>

                <h2>What Was Their Home?</h2>
                <p>Argentine culture is a multi-faceted area. The people enjoy constructing close interpersonal
                    relationships, and tend to be a very open and family centered. Youth tend to spend a longer time living
                    with their parents than even Argentinian-American youth in the US. Family structure is patriarchal,
                    however recent events have led more women to be in typically male-dominated careers. Argentina is
                    recognized as being the Latin American country with the least gender equality, having elected one female
                    president, and two female vice-presidents throughout its history. In 2010, Argentina became the first
                    Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage.</p>
                <p>Mental health is considerably less stigmatized in Argentina compared to the US. Going to therapy, even
                    for many years, is considered the norm, and people often share their experiences with mental counseling.
                    The nation seems to have a vested interest in the field of psychotherapy and specifically
                    psychoanalysis. For comparison, A 2005 study by Kohn et al. that found Argentina had 106 psychologists
                    per 100,000 people, compared to the US’ ratio of 31.1 per 100,000 (of the time)*. The “Universidad de
                    Buenos Aires” a public university in Argentina’s capital, trains the highest number of psychologists in
                    the country.</p>
                <footnote>*Note: This was claimed by A. J. Consoli et al. The actual study by Kohn et al. is entirely in
                    spanish, and unfortunately, I can’t read Spanish. Regardless I cited the original study anyway.

            <h2>When Did Most Immigrate?</h2>
            <p>Argentine citizens have immigrated to the US for a long time, though before 1970, those who immigrated
                were labeled by the American government as part of “other Hispanics”. Sources suggest that the
                population of Argentine-origin in the US has experienced most of its growth and size from the past three
                decades. According to A. J. Consoli et al., about 80% of the aforementioned population in the US report
                living there for at least 11 years, with half of that section saying they have lived there for more than
                20 years. Moslimani et al.’s research is more current however, having data updated to 2021, about 3
                years after Latinx Immigrants publishing in 2018. The Pew Researchers found that the Argentine-origin
                population had increased by 169% since 2000 (110,000 to 290,000). The article also found that 53% of
                foreign-born Argentines have lived in the US for more than 20 years.</p>

                    <li>Andres was raised in Buenos Aires and practiced as a mental health professional. He came to the US
                        in 1985 due to challenges at home and a want to learn English. He would stay in the US without being
                        properly documented, but would eventually make a proper, permanent move to the nation. Andres worked
                        a variety of health and counseling related services, getting his doctorate in counseling psychology
                        at UC Santa Barbara in 1994, and has since stayed at Stanford University. He was initially there for
                        a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship, but eventually became part of the faculty, as a research and
                        bilingual service delivery trainer.</li>
                    <li>Eduardo visited the US in a short trip during his 6-years in Universidad de Buenos Aires. He would
                        get his Ph. D after receiving advice that he won’t be considered a psychologist in the US without
                        one. He and his family initially went to Palo Alto University as a visiting professor for 3 months,
                        but soon it would extend to more than 5 years living in the nation.</li>

                <h2>Why Did They Immigrate?</h2>
                <p>Accounts may differ in regards to why a person, or even a group/generation of Argentine immigrants would
                    emigrate from their home country. Major reasons for spikes in emigration would be to seek better
                    financial opportunity, and to escape the economic and political struggles, which have been a historical
                    recurrence in Argentina.</p>
                <p>For instance, Argentina’s unstable economy and string of dictatorships in the 1950s created significant
                    native emigration. These troubles stemmed from the economy becoming reliant on the prices of commodities
                    in the 1900s, and from there, political instability started to shape in the 30s. An estimated 385,000
                    highly-skilled Argentinians left between the 60s-80s to other countries including the US. Rodriguez
                    claims it was for greater economic opportunities for immigrants in the 60s, and to escape the “dirty
                    war”. This period from the 70s and early 80s was a period of mass imprisonment, torture, and murder to
                    opposition. Despite this, A. J. Consoli et al. Points to how many citizens were not seeking asylum in
                    the US as much due to the government at the time supporting the dictatorship at home.</p>
                <p>An economic and financial downturn in the country in 2001 & 2014 saw another 255,000 Argentinians
                    emigrate to various nations. Many, like A. J. Consoli et al., migrate between the Argentina and America
                    to be closer to family, as well as seek a better quality of life and opportunities.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>They identify with their nationality rather than the more broad category of Latinx or Hispanic due
                    to feelings of identity loss.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They can experience stereotyping by Latin Americans for being Argentinian, and US nationals for
                        being Hispanic.</li>
                    <li>They may also start to reflect on their own nationality, defined by A. J. Consoli et al. as
                        “Argentinidad”, while living in the US</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Many don’t share a high opinion of the US government.</li>
                <li>Language difficulties in not only English, but also in Spanish due to variations of the language
                    (Argentinians speak a variation called Castilian Spanish).</li>

                </ul>
                <li>While technology and social media has abated some of the concern, the cost and distance between
                    nations, as well as the immigration status of the person and challenges in securing visas had made
                    it difficult for a race partially defined by their close familial connections to meet face to face.
                </li>
                <li>Differences between Argentina and the US in terms of social and cultural norms and expectations can
                    create inter-generational conflict.</li>
